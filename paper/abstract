Two factors play a major role in the cultural evolution of language. On the one hand, there is functional pressure towards efficient transfer of information. On the other hand, languages have to be learned repeatedly and will therefore show traces of systematic stochastic disturbances of the transmission of linguistic knowledge. While a lot of attention has been paid to the effects of learning biases on the transmission of language, there is reason to expect that the class of relevant transmission perturbations is much larger. This paper therefore explores potential effects of transmission noise due to errors in the observation of world states. We look at three studies on vagueness, meaning deflation, and underspecified lexical meaning. These suggest that transmission perturbations other than learning biases might help explain attested patterns in the cultural evolution of language and that perturbations due to perceptual noise may produce effects very similar to learning biases.
